# Question Answering with BERT

In this project, a question and answer application was made using the BERT module from the Transformer Library. It pulls the text data in the URL address we have provided and when we ask a question, it searches the answer in that text and reflects it on the screen.

**NOTE:** If you are going to download and use the project, do not forget to edit the template_folder in Flask.

**NOTE:** Please install the used library versions. The library versions used are as follows;
* Transformers : 3.0.2
* Pytorch      : 1.5.0
* Tensorflow   : 2.1.0
* NLTK         : 3.5.0
* Flask        : 1.1.2
